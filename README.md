### Using as standalone application

You can use pre-built executables from [Releases page](https://github.com/gitnew2018/My-OpenPeriscope/releases), or build it by yourself from source [guide link](https://github.com/gitnew2018/My-OpenPeriscope/wiki).

### Using as userscript

1. Install [userscript manager](https://greasyfork.org/help/installing-user-scripts)
1. Click to [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitnew2018/My-OpenPeriscope/master/Periscope_Web_Client.user.js) and then "Install"
1. Navigate to http://example.net

In this case posting to chat will not work.

In userscript version, "Download" link is absent, so you can use downloaderNode (or other program) to download broadcasts:
